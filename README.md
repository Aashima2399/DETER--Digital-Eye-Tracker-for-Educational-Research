# DETER--Digital-Eye-Tracker-for-Educational-Research
Eye tracking in R
## The end goal of the project is to develop a functional and user-friendly eye tracking tool that will enhance student learning. In any class that involves the students learning how to create the most impactful, efficient, and effective business visualizations (bars, graphs, charts, histograms etc.), the teachers face the challenge of making the students understand the best practices to bring the attention of the audience right where it needs to be. Using this tool, the teachers and the students will be able to track the minute and specific eye movements of the audience which will eventually help them analyze and bridge the gap between where the attention (eye) of the audience actually ‘is’ and where it ‘should be’. The goal of this tool is to make data visualization more analytical and backed by logic/reasoning, rather than just being fueled by aesthetics relying on traditional sense or intuition. This tool will ultimately be accessible to a larger number of professors, students, and beginner level graphic designers.
